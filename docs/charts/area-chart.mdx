# Area Chart

Area charts show how quantitative values change over time. They present trends, but can also illustrate the volume. To emphasize the shape the area beneath the line is filled with color, which means the height of the area at any given point also reveals its quantity.

#### Category
- Trend
- Comparison
- Part-to-whole

#### Variations

- **Simple area chart** - presents a trend for a single category.

- **Stacked area chart** - shows how multiple categories form a whole and how this composition changes over time. The stacks may sum up to an absolute total or form a 100% proportion view.

#### Composition
- The line connecting data points are typically straight. Sometimes curved line ‘interpolation’ may help emphasize a general trend above precise point reading.
- Test different chart’s dimensions. The upward and downward slopes can seem more significant if the chart width is narrow and less significant if it is more stretched out.
- The quantitative x-axis for area charts must start from zero as it is the height of the colored area under the trend line that is used to perceive the values.

#### Color
When you want to compare different trends, diversify colors to make it easy to identify proper data series. Use shades and transparency to ensure the readability of the overlapping areas.

#### Annotations
- The main goal of area charts is to present the trend. Help your audience focusing on the general picture by turning off the data marks. Without this unnecessary noise, the trend’s slopes will be clean and pleasant for the eye.
- When you want to compare many categories at once, it is better to use a line chart. Overlapping areas may lose on readability.

#### Applications
- Focus on presenting quantitative data and trends rather than individual data values
- Part-to-whole relationship between different categories
- Comparison of categories’ trends
