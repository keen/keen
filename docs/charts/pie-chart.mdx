# Pie Chart

Pie chart presents how different categories make up a whole. Each group is a circular slice. Its angle represents the percentage proportion. Attribute of color is used to differentiate the categories. The total of all sections must be 100%. Pie chart is one of the simplest of all visualisations. It emphasizes the comparison of a part to a whole and highlights simple portions. Being able to compare one part to another is not the role of pie charts. The individual pieces are more contrasting in side-by-side bars. Bar charts work well when you have very small datasets.

#### Category
- Path to whole

#### Composition
All the slices in a pie chart must add up to 100%. Positioning the first piece at the vertical 12 oâ€™clock position helps to judge its angle value. The descending ordering of sectors helps with the overall readability effort.

#### Color
The pie chart is very simple visually. Color is the only attribute that differentiates categories. Therefore it is important to diversify the hues to maximize the visible difference.

#### Annotations
- In general, pie charts very well present simple slices, such as on-half, one-third, one-quarter.
- If you need to visualize multiple sets of proportions or changes in proportions across conditions, pie charts will be a space-inefficient and confusing solution. Much better in this case will be a stacked bar chart or grouped bar chart.
- Efficient pie chart should not show more than a few values(up to 6). When slices become too small they are hard to understand. This makes the pie chart unsuitable for use with many categories and larger amounts of data.

#### Applications
- Small datasets
- Data as a proportion of a whole

## Plot
