# Introduction

Build, customize, and seamlessly embed customer-facing analytics in your sites and applications with an intuitive data visualization API.

## Why

> *Why we decided to create a charts library from scratch ?*

We tried another solutions for data visualization, however each of them were missing things which was important from our perspective.
When we started a project - our main assumptions were:

- Deliver re-usable and customizable build blocks.
- Provide best experience for `developers` and metrics `users`.
- Leverage the `Keen API` in the best way.
- Make data visualization fast, fun and easy.

## Architecture

In current implementation there are three main packages:
- [@keen.io/charts](?path=/docs/docs-charts--page) - set of re-usable charts plots builded a top of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [D3](https://d3js.org/).
- [@keen.io/widgets](?path=/docs/docs-widgets--page) - set of re-usable components that connects plots with visualization helpers like for eg. *legend*, *filters*.
- [@keen.io/dataviz](?path=/docs/docs-datviz--page) - abstraction layer that connects Keen API with visualization components.
