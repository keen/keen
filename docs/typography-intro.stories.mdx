# Typography

We use two font types in Keen:

- **Lato** - Body & Data typeface  
Main platform font. It is used for most cases as it has good readability. It is used in visualisations.
- **Gangster Grotesk** - Headline typeface  
Use only for headlines, titles. Don't use it for small text.

If there is no additional specification on the mockups, follow these guidelines:  
- Always align text to the left
- Title Case All (except prepositions) words for:  
  - Buttons 
  - Input labels
  - Modals titles
  - (Example: New Query, Go to Saved Queries)
- Use sentence case for messages, tooltip hints (only the first letter of the first word is capitalised).
- Text always should have **proper contrast**. Always make sure if it is readable
- Use small text only when it is necessary
